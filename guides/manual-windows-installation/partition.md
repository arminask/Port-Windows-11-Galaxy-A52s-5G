## Modifying the partition table

**Unmount the Data partition**

Open the menu button in OrangeFox recovery and then click on the **Mount** button. Uncheck the **Data** button.

**Open a terminal/cmd on your PC and enter recovery shell**
```sh
adb shell
```

**Start `parted` program**
```sh
parted /dev/block/sda
```

Enter `p` command to print the existing partitions

You should have 34 partitions in total with the last 34th one being `userdata`.

You will have to delete the `userdata` partition, create Windows partitions and then recreate userdata partition.

<br>

**4. Delete the `userdata` partition**
> Make sure that 34 really is the userdata partition with `p` command first!
```sh
rm 34
```

### Create partitions

**For 128Gb models:**

- Create the ESP partition (571MB)
```sh
mkpart esp fat32 13.2GB 13.8GB
```

- Create the main partition where Windows will be installed to (60GB)
```sh
mkpart win ntfs 13.8GB 73.8GB
```

- Create Android's data partition (53.6GB)
```sh
mkpart userdata ext4 73.8GB 127GB
```

- Make ESP partiton bootable so that the EFI image can detect it
```sh
set 34 esp on
```

**Quit parted**
```sh
quit
```

**Reboot to OrangeFox recovery**
```sh
reboot recovery
```

Rebooting the phone to recovery after modifying partitions is really important.

GPT partition table changes in recovery are only visible after a reboot.

If you don't do this, you won't be able to proceed with the guide!

## Format modified partitions

- Start adb shell again on your PC
```cmd
adb shell
```

- Format the ESP partiton to FAT32
```sh
mkfs.fat -F32 -s1 /dev/block/bootdevice/by-name/esp -n ESPA52SXQ
```

- Format the Windows partition to NTFS
```sh
mkfs.ntfs -f /dev/block/bootdevice/by-name/win -L WINA52SXQ
```

- Format Android data partition

In OrangeFox recovery go to Wipe menu and press Format Data, 
then type `yes`.

## Check if Android still boots
After making changes to the partition table you need to verify if your phone can still boot Android.

Be sure to verify that by rebooting to system.
