and connect your phone to the PC with a USB cable.
- Your phone will now boot to Download mode, then again press
Volume up button to continue and your phone should get detected on Windows.

**Boot to Download mode from recovery**
- If you're using a custom recovery like TWRP or OrangeFox, you can reboot to Download mode
in the recovery `Reboot` menu and select `Download`.

## Flash PIT with Odin
